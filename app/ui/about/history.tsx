        <p>
          The Accountability and Transparency Party is a transformative
          Political Movement that started back in 2019 as YOUTH FOR CHANGE and
          founded by a group of youthful Kenyans who were tired of the rampant
          corruption and lack of accountability in the government.
          <br />
          <br /> They decided to form a political movement that would champion
          for transparency and accountability in the government through
          technology. Since then, the party has grown and gained support from
          people and organizations all over the country who are tired of the
          status quo and want to see real change in Kenya.
